Interlace content from a widget into the post content area.

== Description ==

Interlace widget content with the main post content. You can add a sign up form, or a JavaScript snippet if you want to. It could easily be customized to add virtually any other piece of content.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `widget-interlacer.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add a form to this area? =

Yes, forms interlaced within post content are a great way to engage users.

= Can I interlace PHP?  =

No. Adding PHP to widgets has a whole set of factors to deal with. I don't want to support something like that with this plugin, but there are ways for you to do it.

== Screenshots ==

1. Sample configurations on the WordPress Widget area
2. View of the Post editor without any interlaced content, because authors don't have to add it!
3. Interlaced widget content **in** the post content!

== Changelog ==

* Initial Release
